# CR_API_Test

## Steps to run code
Navigate to project folder and open the Terminal/Commandline and input the following commands
1. npm install
2. Mocha test --timeout=60000

## Notes
I opted to modify the timeout in the command line as the API response time seemed to be fluctuating greatly for me so I decided to not hard code anything in regards to timeouts.
